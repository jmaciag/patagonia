            <h1>Physical Geography</h1>
            <p>
                Argentine Patagonia is for the most part a region of <em><i>steppelike</i></em> plains, rising in a succession of 13 abrupt <em>terraces</em> about 100 metres (330 feet) at a time, and covered with an enormous bed of shingle almost bare of vegetation.[10] In the hollows of the plains are ponds or lakes of fresh and brackish water. Towards the Andes, the shingle gives place to <em><i>porphyry, granite</i></em>, and <em><i>basalt</i></em> lavas, animal life becomes more abundant and vegetation more luxuriant. It is characteristic of the flora of the western coast, and consist principally of <strong>southern beech</strong> and <strong>conifers</strong>. The high rainfall against the western Andes (<em>Wet Andes</em>) and the low sea surface temperatures offshore give rise to cold and humid air masses, contributing to the ice-fields and glaciers, the largest ice-fields in the Southern hemisphere outside of Antarctica.

            <p>
                 Among the depressions by which the plateau is intersected transversely, the principal ones are the <em><i>Gualichu</i></em>, south of the <strong>Río Negro</strong>, the <em>Maquinchao</em> and <em>Valcheta</em> (through which previously flowed the waters of <em><i>Nahuel Huapi</i></em> Lake, which now feed the river <em>Limay</em>); the <strong>Senguerr</strong> (spelled Senguer on most Argentine maps and within the corresponding region), the Deseado River. Besides these transverse depressions (some of them marking lines of ancient inter-oceanic communication), there are others which were occupied by more or less extensive lakes, such as the <cite>Yagagtoo</cite>, <em><i>Musters</i></em> and <em><i>Colhue Huapi</i></em>, and others situated to the south of <em>Puerto Deseado</em>, in the centre of the country.
            </p>
            <p>
            	In the central region volcanic eruptions, which have taken part in the formation of the plateau during the <em><i>Cenozoic</i></em>, cover a large part of the land with basaltic lava-caps; and in the western third, more recent glacial deposits appear above the lava. There, erosion which is caused principally by the sudden melting and retreat of ice aided by <em>tectonic</em> changes, has scooped out a deep longitudinal depression. Best in evidence where in contact with folded <strong><i>Cretaceous</i></strong> rocks which are uplifted by the <em>Cenozoic</em> granite. It generally separates the plateau from the first lofty hills, the ridges generally called the pre-Cordillera. To the west of these, a similar longitudinal depression extends all along the foot of the snowy Andean Cordillera. This latter depression contains the richest and most fertile land of Patagonia. Lake basins along the Cordillera were also excavated by ice-streams, including <em><i>Lake Argentino</i></em> and <em><i>Lake Fagnano</i></em>, as well as coastal bays such as <em><i>Bahía Inútil</i></em>.

            <h2>Geology</h2>
            <p>
            	There have been discrepancies among geologists on the origin of the Patagonian landmass. <strong>Víctor Ramos</strong> has proposed that the Patagonian landmass originated as an <em><i>allochtonous terrane</i></em> that separated from Antarctica and docked in South America 250 to 270 Ma in the Permian era.[11] A 2014 study by <strong>Robert John Pankhurst</strong> and coworkers reject any idea of a far-travelled Patagonia claiming it is likely of <em><i>parautochtonous</i></em> origin (nearby origin).[12]

            <p>
                    The <em>Mesozoic</em> and <em>Cenozoic</em> deposits have revealed a most interesting vertebrate fauna. This, together with the discovery of the perfect cranium of a chelonian of the genus <strong><i>Myolania</i></strong>, which is almost identical with Myolania oweni of the Pleistocene age in Queensland, forms an evident proof of the connection between the Australian and South American continents. The Patagonian Myolania belongs to the Upper Chalk, having been found associated with remains of Dinosauria. Fossils of the mid-Cretaceous Argentinosaurus, which may be the largest of all dinosaurs, have been found in Patagonia, and a model of the mid-Jurassic Piatnitzkysaurus graces the concourse of the Trelew airport (the skeleton is in the Trelew paleontological museum; the museum's staff has also announced the discovery of a species of dinosaur even bigger than Argentinosaurus[13]). Of more than paleontological interest,[14] the middle Jurassic <em><i>Los Molles</i></em> Formation and the still richer late Jurassic (Tithonian) and early Cretaceous (Berriasian) Vaca Muerta formation above it in the Neuquén basin are reported to contain huge hydrocarbon reserves (mostly gas in Los Molles, both gas and oil in Vaca Muerta) partly accessible through hydraulic fracturing.[15] Other specimens of the interesting fauna of Patagonia, belonging to the Middle Cenozoic, are the gigantic wingless birds, exceeding in size any hitherto known, and the singular mammal <em><i>Pyrotherium</i></em>, also of very large dimensions. In the Cenozoic marine formation, a considerable number of cetaceans has been discovered.
