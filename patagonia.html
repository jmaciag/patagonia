	<h2>Patagonia</h2>
    <p>
    	&nbsp;<strong>Patagonia</strong> <em>(Spanish pronunciation: <i>[pa.ta.ˈɣo.ni̯a])</i></em> is a sparsely populated region located at the southern end of <strong>South America</strong>, shared by <em>Argentina</em> and <em>Chile</em>. The region comprises the southern section of the <em>Andes</em> mountains as well as the <i>deserts</i>, <i>steppes</i> and <i>grasslands</i> east of this southern portion of the Andes. Patagonia has two coasts; a western one towards the<strong> <em>Pacific Ocean</em> </strong>and an eastern one towards the <strong><em>Atlantic Ocean</em></strong>.
<br>
	&nbsp;The <em><i>Colorado</i></em> and <em><i>Barrancas</i></em> rivers, which run from the Andes to the Atlantic, are commonly considered the northern limit of <em>Argentine Patagonia</em>. The island of <strong><i>Tierra del Fuego</i></strong> is sometimes included as part of Patagonia. Most geographers and historians locate the northern limit of <em>Chilean Patagonia</em> at <strong><i>Reloncaví Estuary</i></strong>.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
    	The name <strong><em>Patagonia</em></strong> comes from the word <em><i>patagón</i></em> used by <i>Magellan</i> in 1520 to describe the native people that his expedition thought to be giants. It is now believed that the people he called the Patagons were <em>Tehuelches</em>, who tended to be taller than Europeans of the time.
<br>
The Argentine researcher <em>Miguel Doura</em> observed that the name Patagonia possibly derives from the ancient <em>Greek</em> region of modern <strong><em>Turkey</em></strong> called <i>Paflagonia</i>, possible home of the patagon personage in the chivalric romances <cite>Primaleon</cite> printed in 1512, ten years before Magellan arrived in these southern lands. The hypothesis was accepted and published in the <cite><i>New Review of Spanish Philology</i></cite> in the 2011 article

<h2>Physical Geography</h2>
<p>
	&nbsp;<i>Argentine Patagonia</i> is for the most part a region of <em>steppelike</em> plains, rising in a succession of 13 abrupt <em>terraces</em> about 100 metres (330 feet) at a time, and covered with an enormous bed of <em>shingle</em> almost bare of vegetation. In the hollows of the plains are <em>ponds</em> or <em>lakes</em> of fresh and brackish water. Towards the <i>Andes</i>, the shingle gives place to <em><i>porphyry, granite</i></em>, and <em><i>basalt</i></em> lavas, animal life becomes more abundant and vegetation more luxuriant. It is characteristic of the <em>flora</em> of the western coast, and consist principally of <em><i>southern beech</i></em> and <em><i>conifers</i></em>. The high rainfall against the western Andes <em><i>(Wet Andes)</i></em> and the low sea surface temperatures offshore give rise to cold and humid air masses, contributing to the ice-fields and glaciers, the largest ice-fields in the <i>Southern hemisphere</i> outside of <strong><i>Antarctica</i></strong>.<br>
<br>
Among the depressions by which the <em>plateau</em> is intersected transversely, the principal ones are the <em><i>Gualichu</i></em>, south of the <strong><i>Río Negro</i></strong>, the <em><i>Maquinchao</i></em> and <em><i>Valcheta</i></em> (through which previously flowed the waters of <strong><em>Nahuel Huapi Lake</em></strong>, which now feed the river <em>Limay</em>); the <strong><em>Senguerr</em></strong> (spelled Senguer on most Argentine maps and within the corresponding region), <strong><em>the Deseado River</em></strong>. Besides these transverse depressions (some of them marking lines of ancient inter-oceanic communication), there are others which were occupied by more or less extensive lakes, such as the <strong><em>Yagagtoo, Musters</em></strong> and <strong><em>Colhue Huapi</em></strong>, and others situated to the south of <em>Puerto Deseado</em>, in the centre of the country.<br>
<br>

In the central region <em>volcanic eruptions</em>, which have taken part in the formation of the plateau during the <em><i>Cenozoic</i></em>, cover a large part of the land with <em>basaltic lava-caps</em>; and in the western third, more recent glacial deposits appear above the <em>lava</em>. There, erosion which is caused principally by the sudden melting and retreat of ice aided by <em>tectonic changes</em>, has scooped out a deep longitudinal depression. Best in evidence where in contact with folded <strong><em>Cretaceous</em></strong> rocks which are uplifted by the <em><i>Cenozoic</i></em> granite. It generally separates the plateau from the first lofty hills, the ridges generally called the pre-Cordillera. To the west of these, a similar longitudinal depression extends all along the foot of the snowy <em><i>Andean Cordillera</i></em>. This latter depression contains the richest and most fertile land of Patagonia. Lake basins along the Cordillera were also excavated by ice-streams, including <strong><i>Lake Argentino</i></strong> and <strong><i>Lake Fagnano</i></strong>, as well as coastal bays such as <strong><i>Bahía Inútil</i></strong>.<br>
